								<a href="https://github.com/Srivathsan99/Classificaiton-of-Audio-Using-Neural-Network/blob/main/Audio%20Project.ipynb#enroll-beta"><h2>Audio classification using Deep Neural Network</h2></a>
								<ul>
									<li>This project was done working with audio files using librosa instead of scipy.</li>
									<li>Librosa uses mono audio sample conversion by default in 22050 Hz instead of scipyâ€™s 11025Hz.</li>
									<li>Using librosa feature.mfcc (mel frequency cepstral coefficients) we can summarize the frequency distribution.</li>
									<li>MFCC helps us in analyzing the frequency and time characteristics of the source audio.</li>
									<li>Sequential model built along with adam optimizer.</li>
									<li>Dropout (to prevent overfitting) and batch normalization were used on each layer.</li>
								</ul> 
								<a href="https://github.com/Srivathsan99/Movie-Recommendation-System/blob/main/NLP%20Project%20(Movie%20Recommendation).ipynb"><h2>Movie Recommendation System</h2></a>
								<ul>									
									<li>Using tags, genres, average rating, and number of reviewers from different dataset are combined based on the movieID.</li>
									<li>Nans on the tags are filled with genres of the movie.</li>
									<li>As for preprocessing, nltk wordnet Lemmatization was used and the duplicate tags were removed.</li>
									<li>For visualization Joint plot from seaborn were used to represent the frequency of reviewers for the average rating. Word cloud was used to show the most frequently occurring word.</li>
									<li>Count Vectorizer is done to get the frequency count in each tag.</li>
									<li>Finally, the movie recommendation is done based on cosine similarity to compare similarity between the features where 1 and 0 being high and low similarity respectively.</li>
								</ul>
								<a href="https://github.com/Srivathsan99/Heart-Failure/blob/main/Heart.ipynb"><h2>Heart Failure</h2></a>
								<ul>
									<li>Dataset that contains the person and health information of various candidates.</li>
									<li>Heatmap used to visually see the correlation between the feature to determine the required feature.</li>
									<li>Scaling is done using the sklearn library to bring the range of value between 0 and 1.</li>
									<li>Balancing is done by oversampling the class 1 as about 67% of the target were 0.</li>
									<li>Using cross-fold validation for model selection to know the model with consistent performance.</li>
									<li>Ensemble models such as Random Forest and xgboost performed consistently better.</li>
									<li>Learning curve to know more about test and train score.</li>
									<li>Recall is used as evaluation as it is more suited for this scenario.</li>
								</ul>
								<a href="https://github.com/Srivathsan99/Online-Payment-Fraud/blob/main/Online%20Payment%20Fraud.ipynb"><h2>Fraudulent Transaction Detection</h2></a>
								<ul>
									<li>Dataset consists of mixture of integer, float, and object types of features.</li>
									<li>MinMaxScaler is used for scaling the integer data between 0 and 1 whereas the categorical data are converted into integer data.</li>
									<li>The dataset was heavily imbalanced, hence SMOTE technique was used for balancing the dataset.</li>
									<li>Random forest model was used before and after using feature, the accuracy and runtime time were compared.</li>
